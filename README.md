**Task Description for nizPOzNeg_gh:**

Write a program in C# that works with arrays of integers. The task of the program is to:

1. **Initialize** an array of integers containing both positive and negative values.  
2. **Separate** the positive and negative numbers into two distinct arrays:  
   - All positive numbers should be copied into one array.  
   - All negative numbers should be copied into another array.  
3. **Display** the contents of both arrays to the user:  
   - Positive numbers should be displayed under the heading "Positive Numbers:".  
   - Negative numbers should be displayed under the heading "Negative Numbers:".  

**Note:** The length of both auxiliary arrays should be equal to the length of the original array, but unfilled elements (default zero values) should not be displayed.  

**Input Data:**  
An array of integers predefined in the code:  
`{ 12, 23, -22, -765, 43, 545, -4, -55, 43, 12, 351, -999, -87 }`  

**Output Data:**  
The program should display the positive and negative numbers from the original array in two separate groups.



**Task Description:**  

Write a program in C# that calculates the volume of a cylinder. The program should:  

1. **Define a constant** for the mathematical constant Ï€ (Pi) with a value of `3.14`.  
2. **Initialize variables** for the radius (`poluprecnik`) and height (`visina`) of the cylinder with predefined values.  
3. **Calculate** the volume of the cylinder using the formula:  
        Volume=pi*radius**2*height
4. **Display** the result in a user-friendly message, including the radius, height, and calculated volume of the cylinder.  

**Input Data:**  
- Radius (`poluprecnik`): 10  
- Height (`visina`): 50  

**Output Data:**  
A message displaying the cylinder's radius, height, and volume in the following format:  
`The volume of the cylinder with radius 10 and height 50 is 15700.`
