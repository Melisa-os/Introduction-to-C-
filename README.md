**Task Description for nizPOzNeg_gh:**

Write a program in C# that works with arrays of integers. The task of the program is to:

1. **Initialize** an array of integers containing both positive and negative values.  
2. **Separate** the positive and negative numbers into two distinct arrays:  
   - All positive numbers should be copied into one array.  
   - All negative numbers should be copied into another array.  
3. **Display** the contents of both arrays to the user:  
   - Positive numbers should be displayed under the heading "Positive Numbers:".  
   - Negative numbers should be displayed under the heading "Negative Numbers:".  

**Note:** The length of both auxiliary arrays should be equal to the length of the original array, but unfilled elements (default zero values) should not be displayed.  

**Input Data:**  
An array of integers predefined in the code:  
`{ 12, 23, -22, -765, 43, 545, -4, -55, 43, 12, 351, -999, -87 }`  

**Output Data:**  
The program should display the positive and negative numbers from the original array in two separate groups.
